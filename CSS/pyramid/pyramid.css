# Practice: Pyramid

Recreate [the following page](/practice/pyramid-sample.html) using just flexbox and `div`s.

* Each box should be a `div`; there should be no other elements in the `body`
* Every box has a one pixel black border
* "Row" boxes should have 20 pixels of spacing between each other and between the page edges
* "Inner" boxes should have 10 pixels of spacing between themselves and the edge of the "row" box they are in
* Each "row" box should be 100 pixels high (including border) and the full width of the page (taking into account the above spacing)
* Each "inner" box should be the full height of the row (taking into account the above spacing)
* The first "row" box contains one "inner" box that is full width
* The second "row" box contains two "inner" boxes that fill out the full width between them in a 4:1 ratio
* The third "row" box contains three "inner" boxes that are 90 pixels wide and are spread out over the entire "row" box equally horizontally
